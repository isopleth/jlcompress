This is a piece of old coursework that I did years ago.  The task was
to write a file compression program in C that used two compression
techniques.  I chose [run length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) because it was easy to do,
and [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) because it was a bit more tricky.

To build it on Linux, type `make`.
It has various tests, run these using `make test`
