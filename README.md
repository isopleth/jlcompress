This is a slightly modified piece of coursework that I did a decade
ago.  I've changed it to keep up with changes to the C programming
language and compiler etc over the years.  The task was to write a
file compression program in C that used two compression techniques.
I chose [run length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) 
because it was easy to do, and [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)
because it was a bit more tricky and so would be an interesting challenge.

To build it on Linux, type `make`.
It has various tests, run these using `make test`
